    <br>A Digital Portrait During Hong Kong's Anti-Extradition Bill Protests

    <p>I started following the anti-extradition bill protests in Hong Kong intently since July 1, 2019 —
      checking the news, reading up on forums and watching livestreams — every moment awake, or half-awake.
      This daily act has become a huge part of who I am, as if by doing so I could bridge the immense disconnect and guilt I feel 8,000 miles away from
      an event and people I deeply care about.
      <i>What does it really means for something to be constantly on your mind?</i>
      <br><br>
      I collected screenshots from September 11, 2019*, taking a photo and recording information
      about its content and time accessed everytime I actively search for information pertaining the protests,
      or came across information on my social media accounts.
